Here’s a breakdown of potential file extensions that could fit Reverb's features and functionalities:

1. Core Code Files
.rvb: Main Reverb code file extension, for core scripts and code files.
.rvh: Reverb header files, for defining reusable components, functions, or gauge definitions.
.rvlib: Reverb library files, containing custom or prebuilt libraries of functions or modules.
2. Configuration and Settings Files
.rvconf: Configuration files for project settings, including paths, environment variables, and compiler/interpreter settings.
.rvproj: Reverb project files, used for organizing project structure and dependencies.
.rvcfg: Additional configuration file for runtime settings, specific to system or cloud environments.
3. Data and Resource Management Files
.rvd: Reverb data files, specifically for data files that Reverb might process dynamically (e.g., for game assets, AI, or physics simulations).
.rvr: Resource files, specifying CPU, memory, and GPU resource allocations and management rules.
.rvg: Gauge files, for defining reusable gauge configurations for performance monitoring and adaptive scaling.
4. Testing and Diagnostic Files
.rvt: Test files, for unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks specifically for Reverb applications.
.rvl: Log files, for runtime diagnostics, error reports, and profiling data.
5. Additional Specialized Extensions
.rvi: Interface files, especially if Reverb integrates with external APIs or services.
.rvweb: Web configuration files, specific for handling Reverb’s web-based GUI or web integration scripts.
.rve: Export files, if Reverb has options for exporting compiled modules or code.
This collection of file extensions would facilitate organized project management and modular design, reflecting Reverb’s versatility and focus on adaptive performance and distributed processing. Each extension separates functionality, promoting readability and efficient collaboration in a development environment.
